# üìö Library Management System (C++) ‚Äî üöß Under Construction

This is a simple console-based **Library Management System** created using core C++ concepts like **Classes, Objects, Function Overloading**, and **Basic Logic**.

> üöß This project is currently under construction and not production-ready. See "Known Issues" below for current limitations.


##  Features (Implemented)

- Add new books with details (title, author, code, quantity)
- Display all books
- Search books by:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Code
  - Quantity
- Update book quantities (add/remove)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- ‚ùó **While loop input still breaks on invalid (non-integer) inputs.**
- Menu validation exists but isn't fully reliable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Improvements

- [ ] Add robust input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Add saving/loading functionality (file I/O)
- [ ] Modularize the code into separate files
- [ ] Optional: Add GUI version using FLTK or Qt
